# 🧠 Project Development Log – `loan_analysis`

This document tracks the week-by-week and feature-by-feature development of this project. It's used to demonstrate steady, authentic progress and intentional design decisions.

---

## 📅 Week 1: Initial Setup
- ✅ Set up Python 3.13 with `pyenv` and `uv`
- ✅ Created virtual environment `.venv` isolated from system Python
- ✅ Initialized Git repository and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Created `pyproject.toml` using `setuptools` structure
- ✅ Wrote a clean, minimal `loan_analysis` package in `src/`

---

## 📅 Week 2: Core Functionality
- 🔄 Implement core loan calculation logic (monthly payments, amortization)
- 🔄 Add CLI entry point via `__main__.py`
- ⏳ Start unit tests using `unittest` or `pytest`

---

## 📅 Week 3 (Planned): Visualizations and Output
- ⏳ Add matplotlib graphs: principal vs. interest over time
- ⏳ Allow CSV export of schedule
- ⏳ Add error handling and input validation

---

## ✅ Future Plans
- Web interface (Flask/FastAPI)
- Integration with financial APIs
- Variable interest rate support
- Interactive dashboards (Streamlit?)

---

## 📌 Notes
- All code is original and written from scratch
- Documentation and refactoring is done alongside feature development
